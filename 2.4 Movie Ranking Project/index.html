   <h1>Movies and Series Reviews according to Abi</h1>
    <h2>What I watched in 2024</h2> <hr>
    <h3>House of Dragon</h3>
    <p>Intense, entertaining prequel to the Games of Thrones Series. I would give it a 7/10</p>
    <h3>Our Blues</h3>
    <p>It's a korean drama and that's what it is: A Drama. It has good character development for the kdrama standards and you can see some of the stereotypes and prejudices the society still has. I would give it a 6/10 which is high for its category.</p>
    <h3>Everything, Everywhere, all at once</h3>
    <p>This movie is kind of A Lot. It's entertaining and crazy but it can get to a point where you just say wtf. Some jokes are not necessary and it feels super long. But it has some nice quotes and life lessons I guess. 5/10</p>
